## What is Extorius?

Extorius is a library of Roblox scripts, providing for all your script needs. From Self-Bots, to Alt Controllers, to Hubs, we truly have it all.
Where most fail to have vastly different scripts, we excell, ensuring we do not lose quality whilst having so much in quantity.
If our scripts have competition, you can be sure they're at the top of it.

## What is Extorius Self-Bot?

Extorius Self-Bot is our newest release. Open-source, keyless, and all around not a hassle to use, this advanced and fun script allows everyone in the server to be in on the fun.
### Advanced Points System
This fun and intuitive points system prevents spam for you, and keeps the bot fun for others.
Every time players use commands, they're deducted points. However, certain commands will then give back points. This helps prevent spam for more dangerous commands (such as die), and keeps the bot interesting for the ones using it.
### Easy to Use Commands
Normal users, admins, and owners alike will find that using this script is hassle-free experience.
Saving you time, you don't need to enter full usernames. Extorius Self-Bot will automatically find the closest matching username or display name for any commands requiring a player.
### Blacklisting and Admins
Someone spamming commands? Bothering you? Keeps throwing you off the edge of the map? Blacklist them!
By simply saying "add blacklist (username)" in chat, you can completely disable that player's ability to use any and all commands, in every server, on every account you use!
If you wanna give someone the ability to give others points, or even blacklist others, you can do so by giving them admin.
"add admin (username)" will allow whoever you want to be able to add points or blacklists to other players in the server. Just like blacklisting, this will save across every server, and every account you use.
